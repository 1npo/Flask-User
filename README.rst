User Login for Flask: Register, Confirm email, Forgot password and more
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

| Many Flask websites require that their users can Register, Confirm email, Login, Logout, Change password and Reset forgotten passwords.
| Each website often requires different and precise customization of this process.

Flask-User aims to provide a ready to use **and** fully customizable package that offers:

* **Reliable** user management functionality,
* **Secure** password hashing and token encryption and signing,
* **Ready to use** after an easy install and setup,
* **Fully customizable** through well documented config settings and attributes, and
* **Good documentation**

I've successfully used `Flask-Security <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/>`_ in the past.
Flask-Security offers additional role based authentication.
