Customizing One
===============

::

    !! News Flash !!
    The following application config names have changed for intuitive and consistency reasons:
    - USER_LOGIN_WITH_USERNAME --> USER_ENABLE_USERNAMES (plural)
    - USER_REGISTER_WITH_EMAIL --> USER_ENABLE_EMAILS (plural)
    - USER_RETYPE_PASSWORD     --> USER_USER_ENABLE_RETYPE_PASSWORDS (plural)
    We apologize for any inconvenience but feel confident this will help going forward.

Level One customizations just require changing a setting in the application config.
These customizations have been well tested through our automated tests
and can be applied safely.
